# OpenPizza

## What is it?

OpenPizza is a community driven open source initiative to create a YAML-based standard and database for pizza recipes.

## Why YAML?

We believe that the strengths of the YAML format makes it a good fit for pizza recipes. It's lightweight, easy to use and it's perfect to build tools for!

We also feel that the YAML Schema is mature enough for writing usable semantics.

## Open Source

The schema is open source and community-driven.
